# Admin Dashboard | The Odin Project

This project was designed for The Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS course, and is mostly meant to demonstrate using CSS Grid to follow a design image. As usual, I followed the structure, but took my own route with styling and responsiveness. No Javascript included in this project.
